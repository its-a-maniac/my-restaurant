               <h3>At its_maniac, we view life as a never-ending series of journeys. Sometimes those journeys take us across time zones and continents; sometimes they simply take us across town. Regardless, each voyage marks us with its own indelible stamp, coloring our memories and sculpting our individual identities.</h3>

                    We believe the journey of your life deserves worthy travel companions, such as the heirloom-quality leather bags and accessories we have been making for generations. Handcrafted by artisans using the finest materials, each piece is made not to withstand life’s adventures, but to be molded by them.

                    As with many things in life, a Ghurka only gets better with age and experience—the beautiful patina it develops capturing sun-soaked days, rain-slicked nights and every unexpected detour in between. A lived-in and well-loved Ghurka becomes like a second passport, marked with moments large and small—what you reach for to remember past journeys, and light the spark for future endeavors.

                    In 1975, our founder Marley Hodgson drew inspiration from military campaign gear to create the first Ghurka design at our factory in Norwalk, CT. Today we remain true to our roots, continuing to craft timeless, high-quality designs in that very same facility.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Yet, resting on our laurels has never suited us. We continue to innovate to meet our customers’ evolving needs and exceed their expectations, while staying faithful to our roots. We never forget that our customers are what make our designs special—their stories, their passion and the way they pass their Ghurkas to the next generation. We look forward to helping you shine on your journey, wherever it may take you.
